# [](#header-about)About

Created a full-featured, responsive website for Precision Auto Body & Detailing based out of San Francisco, California.  Precision Auto Body & Detailing came to me asking for a new look and feel for their website.  They also had data supporting the idea that most of their users were coming from mobile devices.  This information allowed me to create a beautiful, mobile-first website that left both the client & their future customers happy.
